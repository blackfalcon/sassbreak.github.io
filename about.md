Sass break is a humble new blog for the Sass community. It's currently maintained and curated by [David Conner](https://twitter.com/Dave_Conner) and [Guil Hernandez](https://twitter.com/guilh). If you'd like to contribute an article to Sass break, [let us know](mailto:sassbreak@gmail.com).

Sass break was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) *(of course)*, and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Follow [@sassbreak](https://twitter.com/sassbreak) on Twitter for more updates.
