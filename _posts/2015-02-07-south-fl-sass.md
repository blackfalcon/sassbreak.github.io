In an effort to grow&mdash;and get to know&mdash;the awesome Sass community in South Florida, we've started a new meetup to talk about all things Sass!

The meetups will consist of meet and greets followed by talks and presentations by local designers and developers. We're currently searching the Palm Beach County area for the perfect venue. 

If you're in the South Florida area, we'd love to have you! Follow [@sflsass](https://twitter.com/sflsass) on Twitter for updates.
