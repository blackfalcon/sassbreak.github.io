<p>CSS needs to be reusable, scalable and adaptable to different use cases. When writing modular CSS, our goal should be to get to a point where modifying or re-arranging anything about the structure will not break the front-end.</p>

<h3>Slides for CSS Summit 2015 presentation</h3>

<p>In this session from <a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/2015/css-summit/">CSS Summit 2015</a>, Guil covers how to use many of the best practices and principles of modular CSS architecture with Sass. Youâ€™ll learn how a modular approach with Sass can boost your front-end workflow and cut down on maintenance, including:</p>

<ul>
	<style type="text/css">
		li { list-style: disc; }
	</style>
	<li >How to write code that scales, no matter how big the project</li>
	<li>Writing code others can easily read and maintain</li>
